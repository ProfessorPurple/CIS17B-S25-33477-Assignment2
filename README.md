This program is a simple menu based library system at a School. 
It can store books, users of both student and faculty, as well as allow transactions to be made by those users. You can also add books to the system as well as more users. 

Editing of the users is possible through the menu system.
Adding books is allowed but a library is public and will always allow the freedom to read, so removal of books is not possible, only checking out.

Users can check out up to 3 books at any given time, if they try to checkout more they will be told they must return some before they can get any more.

there are several listing options in this program that print out user information alongside their checked books, if any exist. There are lists for the books in the system that shows Title, authors name, ISBN, and availability.

Please have fun with the joys of reading!
